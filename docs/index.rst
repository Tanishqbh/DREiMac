DREiMac: Dimension Reduction with Eilenberg-MacLane Coordinates
===============================================================

DREiMac is a library for topological data coordinatization, visualization, and dimensionality reduction.
Currently, DREiMac is able to find topology-preserving representations of point clouds taking values in the circle, in higher dimensional tori, and in the real projective space.
