Theory
======

DREiMac is based on `cohomology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohomology>`_ and `Eilenberg-MacLane spaces <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilenberg%E2%80%93MacLane_space#Bijection_between_homotopy_classes_of_maps_and_cohomology>`_, and turns persistent cohomology computations into topology-preserving coordinates for data.
We now give details about what this means.
For more information, please see the corresponding papers for the circular coordinates algorithm [1]_, the toroidal coordinates algorithm [2]_, and the projective coordinates algorithm [3]_.

Inputs
------

DREiMac currently implements three cohomological coordinates procedures: the circular coordinates algorithm, the toroidal coordinates algorithm, and the real projective coordinates algorithm.
All procedures take 4 main parameters:

1. A dataset :code:`X`, which can be either a point cloud :math:`X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n` or a distance matrix.

The dataset is interpreted as a finite sample of a continuous space :math:`X \subseteq M`.
In order to speed-up computations, a subsample of the initial dataset is computed :math:`L \subseteq X`, using a minmax sampling procedure.

2. The :code:`n_landmarks` parameter determines the size of the subsample :math:`L`.

Then, a persistent homology computation is done using the Vietoris-Rips complex :math:`R(L)` of the metric space :math:`L`, which returns the persistence diagram of :math:`PH^n(R(L),\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})`.
For this, a cohomological dimension :math:`n \in \mathbb{N}` and a prime :math:`p` must be chosen.
Right now, DREiMac supports arbitrary primes but only :math:`n=1`.
The choice of these parameters will depend on which of DREiMac's cohomological coordinates one is using.

- For circular and toroidal coordinates, the user can choose any prime :math:`p` and :math:`n` is set to :math:`1` automatically.

- For real projective coordinates, the prime :math:`p` is set to :math:`2` and :math:`n` is set to :math:`1`, automatically.

Then, looking at the persistence diagram, a cohomology class is chosen by the user, as follows.

3. A cohomology class :math:`\eta \in PH^n(R(L);\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})` is selected using the :code:`cocycle_idx` parameter, which indicates the index of the cohomology class when they are ordered with respect to their persistence (i.e., their distance to the diagonal).

Finally:

4. The number :math:`0 <` :code:`perc` :math:`< 1` specifies a time in the filtration is chosen in order to construct the coordinates.


Ouput
-----

With these choices, DREiMac returns a map

.. math::

   f_\eta \;:\; L^{\alpha}\; \xrightarrow{\;\;\;\;\;\;}\; K(G,n)

where:

- :math:`K(G,n)` is an Eilenberg-MacLane space (EM space). Specifically, when using the

   - Circular coordinates algorithm, the EM space is the circle :math:`S^1`;
   - Toroidal coordinates algorithm, the EM space is a torus, i.e., a product of circles :math:`S^1 \times \dots \times S^1`;
   - Real projective coordinates algorithm, the EM space is a real projective space :math:`RP^k`. In this case, the dimension :math:`k` is selected using the :code:`proj_dim` parameter.

- :math:`L^{\alpha} = \{m \in M : d_M(m,L) < \alpha\}` is the :math:`\alpha`-thickening of :math:`L` inside :math:`M`.

- :math:`\alpha = (1 - \rho)\cdot \max\{d_H^M(L,X), 2 \cdot birth(\eta)\} + \rho \cdot death(\eta)`, where :math:`\rho =` :code:`perc`.

Guarantee
---------

The output map :math:`f_\eta : L^{\alpha} \to K(G,n)` is guaranteed to preserve the cohomology class :math:`\eta`, in the following sense.
When one takes the pullback of the fundamental class of :math:`K(G,n)` along the map :math:`f_\eta`, and restricts it to the Vietoris-Rips complex :math:`R_{\alpha/2}(L)`, one gets back the user-chosen cohomology class :math:`\eta`.
